# LRU Cache Visualizer

This project is an interactive LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how an LRU cache stores recently accessed items and removes the least recently used element when the cache reaches its capacity.

Users can perform cache operations such as inserting values and accessing keys, while the interface updates in real time to show how items move based on usage. The visualization helps in understanding how caching improves performance by keeping frequently used data readily available.

The project focuses on implementing core LRU logic in JavaScript and integrating it with a simple, responsive UI. It is useful for learning data structures, practicing frontend development, and preparing for coding interviews where LRU Cache is a common design problem.
